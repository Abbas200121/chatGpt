### **ChatGPT-App Development Progress**

## Studying Full-Stack Development and API Usage – 5 Hours

Learned how to build a full-stack application, studied API structures, requests, and responses, and explored integrating external APIs with FastAPI.

## Backend Development and AI Response System – 20 Hours

Developed the backend using FastAPI, implemented an endpoint to receive user messages, integrated the Hugging Face API for AI-generated responses, and designed database models connected to MySQL for message storage.

## Testing Backend with Postman – 2 Hours

Used Postman to send API requests and verify responses, identified and fixed errors in request handling and API responses.

## Frontend Development – 10 Hours

Built a React.js UI to send and display messages, connected the frontend to the FastAPI backend, developed models and API services to handle requests, and displayed AI responses properly in the chat interface.

## Improving AI Response Display and UI – 3 Hours

Changed how AI responses are displayed from instant appearance to a dynamic, human-like typing effect, improved UI styling, and enhanced message animations for a better user experience.

## Implementing Authentication (Login & Signup) – 10 Hours

Implemented JWT authentication for user login and signup, enforced authentication so that only logged-in users can send messages, used password hashing to store passwords securely in MySQL, and fixed issues where the server sometimes failed to send tokens or encountered authentication errors.

## Enhancing Chat Storage – 8 Hours

Implemented per-user chat history storage, ensuring each user sees only their own previous chats upon login. Enhanced the backend to fetch and display user-specific chats so that users can review old messages after logging in.

## Multi-Session Chat Support – 15 Hours

Modified the backend to allow users to create multiple chat sessions while keeping all their past chats intact. Updated the frontend to display a list of active user chats, making it easy to switch between conversations seamlessly.

## Google Authentication and Logout – 10 Hours

Integrated Google OAuth for authentication, allowing users to log in with their Google accounts. Fixed issues with token handling and ensured that users remain authenticated after logging in. Added a logout button to allow users to clear their session securely.

## Fixing Authentication Issues and Token Handling – 4 Hours

Resolved issues with JWT tokens not being sent properly during login. Ensured tokens are correctly stored and retrieved on the frontend. Fixed bugs where some authentication requests were failing due to incorrect token handling in FastAPI middleware.
